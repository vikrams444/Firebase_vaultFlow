# **✅ Prompts & Security Rules Used in the Video** 

### **Prompt 1 — Connect Firebase Authentication**

**Purpose:**  
 **Connect the Google AI Studio project to Firebase using the Web SDK config \+ enable Sign Up, Login, Logout.**

Connect my existing web app to Firebase using this SDK:  
\[firebaseConfig]  
Requirements:  
\- Use Firebase Authentication only  
\- Do NOT use Firestore or Storage yet  
\- Do NOT redesign the UI  
Authentication behavior:  
\- Users can sign in using email and password  
\- If credentials are incorrect, show:  
  "Email or password is incorrect"  
\- Users can sign up using email and password  
\- If the email already exists, show:  
  "User already exists. Please sign in"  
\- For now:  
  \- Authenticate users only  
  \- Do NOT save user profile data  
Flow:  
\- On successful sign-in or sign-up, redirect to the dashboard  
\- Add a logout button that signs the user out and returns to the auth screen  
---

### **Prompt 2 — Implement Email Verification**

**Purpose:**  
 **Enable email verification flow (no auto-login, block unverified users, show verification screen).**

Implement email verification using Firebase Authentication only.  
\- When a user registers with email/password, do not sign them in automatically.  
\- Send a verification email and show a verification screen with this message:“We have sent you a verification email to \[user email\]. Please verify it and log in.”  
\- Include a Login button on the verification screen.  
\- If a user logs in and their email is not verified, block access and show the same verification screen.  
\- Do not use Firestore or any database — Firebase Authentication only.

---

### **Prompt 3 — Add Firestore Dashboard Sections**

**Purpose:**  
 **Add “My Files”, “My Notes”, and “Team Members” sections and store all data in Firestore under the user.**

Enhance the current dashboard by adding 3 fully functional sections:  
1\) My Files  
2\) My Notes  
3\) Team Members

IMPORTANT RULES:  
\- Use Firebase Authentication \+ Firestore only.  
\- Do NOT use browser prompts (window.prompt / alert).  
\- Use clean in-app modals for all actions.  
\- Each user sees ONLY their own data.  
\- Keep the existing VaultFlow UI style (cards, spacing, buttons).

\====================  
DATA STRUCTURE  
\====================

Use Firestore under the authenticated user:

users/{uid}  
\- displayName  
\- email  
\- plan  
\- createdAt

users/{uid}/folders/{folderId}  
\- name  
\- createdAt

users/{uid}/files/{fileId}  
\- name  
\- folderId (optional)  
\- size  
\- createdAt  
(Note: metadata only, no real uploads yet)

users/{uid}/notes/{noteId}  
\- title  
\- content (optional)  
\- createdAt

users/{uid}/teamMembers/{memberId}  
\- name  
\- role (optional)  
\- createdAt

\====================  
UI BEHAVIOR  
\====================

My Files  
\- Buttons: "New Folder" and "Add File"  
\- Show folders and files  
\- Empty state \+ loading state

My Notes  
\- Button: "New Note"  
\- Show notes as cards  
\- Empty state \+ loading state

Team Members  
\- Button: "Add Member"  
\- Show list of members  
\- Empty state \+ loading state

\====================  
MODALS (NO BROWSER PROMPTS)  
\====================

\- New Folder: input name → save to Firestore  
\- Add File: name \+ optional folder \+ size → save  
\- New Note: title \+ content → save  
\- Add Member: name \+ role → save

All modals:  
\- Cancel / Create  
\- Validation  
\- Loading state  
\- Update UI instantly after save

\====================  
SECURITY  
\====================

Add Firestore rules so:  
\- Only the logged-in user can read/write their own data  
\- request.auth.uid must match {uid}

\====================  
RESULT  
\====================

After refresh:  
\- Data persists  
\- Buttons work  
\- Counts update  
\- No browser dialogs  
\- Dashboard feels like a real SaaS app

### **Prompt 4 — Connect My Files to Firebase Storage**

**Purpose:**  
 **Enable real file uploads, downloads, and deletion using Firebase Storage \+ Firestore metadata.**

Connect the existing “My Files” section to Firebase Storage \+ Firestore.

CONTEXT  
\- Firebase Auth \+ Firestore already work in this project.  
\- Firebase Storage is enabled.  
\- Storage rules allow only:  
  /user\_uploads/{uid}/{allPaths=\*\*}  for the logged-in user.

GOAL  
Make these buttons fully functional:  
1\) Add File (upload)  
2\) Download  
3\) Delete  
And keep the current UI style (table, buttons, spacing). No redesign.

IMPORTANT RULES  
\- Use Firebase Authentication \+ Firestore \+ Firebase Storage only.  
\- Do NOT use browser prompts (window.prompt/alert).  
\- Use clean in-app modal for “Add File”.  
\- Each user sees ONLY their own files.  
\- Upload path MUST be:  
  user\_uploads/{uid}/{fileName}  
\- Save metadata in Firestore under:  
  users/{uid}/files/{fileId}

UI BEHAVIOR  
A) Add File button  
\- Open an in-app modal: “Upload File”  
\- Inside modal:  
  \- File picker (click to choose file) using a hidden \<input type="file"\>  
  \- Optional: select folder (if folders exist)  
  \- Upload button  
  \- Show upload progress (percentage) \+ loading state  
\- When upload finishes:  
  \- Save metadata doc to Firestore:  
    users/{uid}/files/{fileId} with:  
      \- name (original file name)  
      \- storagePath (e.g. user\_uploads/{uid}/{fileId}-{name})  
      \- downloadURL  
      \- size  
      \- type (mimeType)  
      \- folderId (optional)  
      \- createdAt (serverTimestamp)  
  \- Update the UI immediately (add row in the table)

B) Display files  
\- In “My Files” table, show:  
  \- name  
  \- type  
  \- size  
  \- actions: Download \+ Delete  
\- Use the Firestore list under users/{uid}/files ordered by createdAt desc.

C) Download button  
\- Use the stored downloadURL from Firestore  
\- Open it safely in a new tab OR trigger download (but no alert).

D) Delete button  
\- Delete from Storage using storagePath  
\- Then delete the Firestore document  
\- Update UI instantly

EDGE CASES  
\- If user is not logged in, block access.  
\- Handle errors with inline UI message in the modal (no alerts).  
\- Prevent double uploads (disable button during upload).  
\- If upload fails, show error message.

DELIVERABLE  
\- Implement the missing handlers, modal, and Storage/Firestore logic.  
\- Keep current design. Do not refactor unrelated code.

### **Prompt 5 — Add Free Plan File Limit (5 Files)**

**Purpose:**  
 **Disable the Add File button when user reaches 5 files and show an Upgrade message.**

Add a free-plan limit to this app:

• Max files allowed: 5  
• Count files under: users/{uid}/files  
• If file count \>= 5:  
– Disable Add File  
– Show message: “You’ve reached the free plan limit.”  
– Add an Upgrade button that opens a simple modal  
(title: “Upgrade your plan”, text \+ Close button)

No real payments.  
UI only.  
Keep current design.  
Apply logic only to the logged-in user.

### **Security Rules**

1. **Firestore Security Rules (Per-User Data Isolation)**

rules\_version \= '2';

service cloud.firestore {

  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Root user document

    match /users/{userId} {

      allow read, write: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid \== userId;

      // Anything nested inside this user:

      // subcollections, documents, folders, files, unlimited levels

      match /{allPaths=\*\*} {

        allow read, write: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid \== userId;

      }

    }

  }

}

2. **Firebase Storage Security Rules (Per-User File Isolation)**

rules\_version \= '2';

service firebase.storage {  
  match /b/{bucket}/o {  
    match /user\_uploads/{uid}/{allPaths=\*\*} {  
      allow read, write: if request.auth \!= null && request.auth.uid \== uid;  
    }  
  }  
}
